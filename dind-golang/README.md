# Docker-in-Docker + Golang
This image is based on the [Go Alpine Image](https://github.com/docker-library/golang/blob/master/1.12/alpine3.10/Dockerfile) but is built on top of the official [Docker in Docker](https://github.com/docker-library/docker/blob/27471a8b93e980bd4c51464ee933ed90fd36bf97/18.09/dind/Dockerfile) image.
This is being used to run certain Go tests with Docker inside a container.
